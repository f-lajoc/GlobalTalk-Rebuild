## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS 

### Thoughts & Troubles

- I tried out Tailwind CSS for the first time, had hiccups configuring it on PC, and the major issue i faced in this project is light being so unstable and the PC i collected has a weak battery, it can't last 10 minutes unpluggedðŸ˜“

- I wanted to get hang of coding on PC but due to the light  bring unstable and deadline, i resorted to my phone at least minute, but i was able to learn how to configure tailwind on PC so that the styling can work without internet connection though i ended up using the CDN on phone which will need internet connection to apply the styles

- This project took me about 5hrs to build using my mobile phone

- I did not have major trouble since i have most css knowledge to make my style work, i just search the documentation for each property & value i need every step using the tailwind documentation

### What I learned and used

- I got to know how to add Google font to Tailwind.

- I learnt tailwind installation configuration which i still need to use more to get used and better hang of

- I noticed that on another device, the tailwind style is not applied and i read in the documentation that the cdn is not best choice for production (not sure if that's why)

- After deploying, i inspected on chrome and made few changes, then copied the code from my github to the local editor on pc since i already have the tailwind condigured for the project, then i uploaded the packages back to github, and everything is working fine ðŸ˜Š

### Continued development
 
- Get better at Tailwind CSS 
- Rebuild CreateCo using Tailwind CSS
